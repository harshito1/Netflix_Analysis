# Netflix_Content_Analysis

## Objective

The objective of the Netflix Content Analysis project is to explore and analyze Netflix's global content library to derive meaningful insights about content distribution, genre variety, country-wise contributions, and viewer preferences. Using Python, advanced data analysis techniques, and visualizations, this project aims to uncover trends that can assist in understanding Netflix's content strategies and inform decision-making for business and viewers alike.

## Overview
